    <h1>Version 3</h1>
    <p>A simple PTO calculator that uses how many years you worked to get correct PTO rate. Then uses how many weeks you have worked so far this year to calculate total PTO to date. Then deducts any PTO that you have taken to date. Results can be returned in hours or days or weeks.</p>
    <p>less than 5 rate is 5</p>
    <p>1-4 years = 5 hours</p>
    <p>5 years = 6 hours</p>
    <p>10 years = 7</p>
